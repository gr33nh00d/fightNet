## About
We created a back-propagation, multi-layer perceptron network into which we input fighter physical stats and data from a fighters' last 10 rounds of fights. The network outputs a prediction as to which fighter is most likely to win in a matchup. 


## Current Issues
Running the dataFormer.py will dos the ufc page to the point of being locked out.
