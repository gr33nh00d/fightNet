## About
We created a back-propagation, multi-layer perceptron network into which we input fighter physical stats and data from a fighters' last 10 rounds of fights. Given the names of two fighters, the network outputs a prediction as to which fighter is most likely to win in a matchup. The purpose of this network is to provide data-driven insights for betting. 


## Current Issues
Running the dataFormer.py will (unintentionally) DOS the ufc page to the point of being locked out (Error 429).
